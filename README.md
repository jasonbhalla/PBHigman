Transformer-augmented local-search pipelines over large graph state spaces using custom heuristic operators, deep
learning, and automated hyperparameter tuning to learn scalable finite approximations of infinite algebraic structures.

_NOTE: This project is a work in progress. I am working on more complicated sofic approximations for more complex groups, and the pipeline to the deep learning approach for utilizing the training data (graphs before/after gluing with scores) to "learn" the best ways to maximize the score in order to be able to generate sofic approximations for very complicated groups._
